#Berlin Clock

Berlin clock sample implementation. The clock logic is as follows:

It uses colored lamps to display time.

Top yellow lamp row represents second but doesn't tell its count only if the value is even (Yellow) or odd (Off).
 
The next 2 red lamp rows give hours of a day. The 1st row consists of 4 lamps representing 20 hours in total.
The 2nd row also has 4 lamps but represent 4 hours in total. The lamps values are added if they are On (Red).
 
The next 2 yellow lamp rows represent the minutes. The 1st row has 11 lamps representing 55 minutes in total. The
2nd row consists of 4 lamps representing 4 minutes in total. The lamps values are added if they are On (Yellow)
